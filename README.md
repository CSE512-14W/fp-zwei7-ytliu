We spent most of the time working on experiment design and data analysis, it is challengable while worthy to conduct on such a unique visualization research study. Also, we learned a lot from the discussion with Jeff, and Steven(MSR), and visitors' feedback from the final poster presentation inspired us as well. It is a valuable project as a whole, and we do enjoy the process.

####Abstract
The research focuses on the effectiveness of communicating a simple chart to audiences. The original hypothesis is that presenting a single statistic data chart sequentially works better than presenting it un-sequentially, in terms of the degree of understanding for audience. Base on the hypothesis,  nine simple charts contain bar, line and scatter plot charts are chosen from The Economist with designed follow-up questions to conduct experiments for quantifying participantsâ€™ degree of understanding toward the chart on Amazon Mechanical Turk. After analyzing 180 responses, the results turns out that presenting a chart sequentially comes out with better results. However, statistically speaking, there is no significant difference between presenting the chart sequentially and un-sequentially. We analyzed and discussed the reasons behind, and addressed our limitations and future work by the end of the paper.
